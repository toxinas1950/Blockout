## 🎮 What’s This?
Think classic **Breakout**, but make it look like it was built in Minecraft after three cans of Red Bull. You’ve got:
- Chunky **grass/dirt borders** you can actually bounce off
- Ore‑themed bricks - Emerald, Diamond, Gold, the lot
- A nice wooden paddle (smooth as butter, pffft)
- Pixel confetti when you smash a brick
- Score, levels, lives — the full arcade treatment
